- implement SSC version of syntax, derive the CwF style syntax from it
  
- write a paper about the above: this is a simpler presentation of the
  syntax of type theory which is equivalent to the CwF-style syntax,
  just like combinator logic is equivalent to lambda calculus (only
  the syntaxes)
  
- maybe compare with natural model style syntax (which does not have
  transport hell)
