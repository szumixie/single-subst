abstract = {Publisher Summary
The theory of types is intended to be a full-scale system for formalizing intuitionistic mathematics as developed. The language of the theory is richer than the languages of traditional intuitionistic systems in permitting proofs to appear as parts of propositions so that the propositions of the theory can express properties of proofs. There are axioms for universes that link the generation of objects and types and play somewhat the same role for the present theory as does the replacement axiom for Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. The present theory is based on a strongly impredicative axiom that there is a type of all types in symbols. This axiom has to be abandoned, however, after it has been shown to lead to a contraction. This chapter discusses Normalization theorem, which can be strengthened in two ways: it can be made to cover open terms and it can be proved that every reduction sequence starting from an arbitrary term leads to a unique normal term after a finite number of steps. The definition of the notion of convertibility and the proof that an arbitrary term is convertible can no longer be separated because the type symbols and the terms are generated simultaneously.}

abstract="We show how the categorical logic of the untyped, simply typed and dependently typed lambda calculus can be structured around the notion of category with families (cwf). To this end we introduce subcategories of simply typed cwfs (scwfs), where types do not depend on variables, and unityped cwfs (ucwfs), where there is only one type. We prove several equivalence and biequivalence theorems between cwf-based notions and basic notions of categorical logic, such as cartesian operads, Lawvere theories, categories with finite products and limits, cartesian closed categories, and locally cartesian closed categories. Some of these theorems depend on the restrictions of contextuality (in the sense of Cartmell) or democracy (in the sense of Clairambault and Dybjer). Some theorems are equivalences between notions with strict preservation of chosen structure. Others are biequivalences involving notions without chosen structure, and where properties are (necessarily) only preserved up to isomorphism. The cwf-based notions play the role of an abstract syntax of formal systems, and we discuss various constructions of initial ucwfs, scwfs, and cwfs with extra structure. As a corollary of our results we show that equality in the free locally cartesian closed category is undecidable.",

abstract="Beluga is an environment for programming and reasoning about formal systems given by axioms and inference rules. It implements the logical framework LF for specifying and prototyping formal systems via higher-order abstract syntax. It also supports reasoning: the user implements inductive proofs about formal systems as dependently typed recursive functions. A distinctive feature of Beluga is that it not only represents binders using higher-order abstract syntax, but directly supports reasoning with contexts. Contextual objects represent hypothetical and parametric derivations, leading to compact and elegant proofs. Our test suite includes standard examples such as the Church-Rosser theorem, type uniqueness, proofs about compiler transformations, and preservation and progress for various ML-like languages. We also implemented proofs of structural properties of expressions and paths in expressions. Stating these properties requires nesting of quantifiers and implications, demonstrating the expressive power of Beluga.",

abstract = {In ordinary lambda calculus the occurrences of a bound variable are made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus.},
