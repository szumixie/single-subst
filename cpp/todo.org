  I don't see the point of introducing first Sub* then Tms, rather than Tms directly, could you clarify?

  > [equation]

  Maybe add a little bit of explanation on the intuition for the right-hand side of the equation? Am I right
  that this is basically doing
  1) weaken `B` to the new context `Î”` in which the `a_i` live 
  2) replace the old variables of `B` one by one by the `a_i`, which are well-typed because of the above
  weakening?
