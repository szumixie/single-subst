formalisation TODOs:
- ConP -> ConS                  difficult, but already done
- ConS -> ConP                  easy because IP is already an S-model
- ConS -> ConP -> ConS = id     we have to show that this map is an S-homomorphism, then we get that it is equal to the identity
- ConP -> ConS -> ConP = id     we have to show that this map is an P-homomorphism, then we get that it is equal to the identity
- one of these:
  - notion of S,P models, homomorphisms, uniqueness
  - just define the above functions and prove the two equations using induction
