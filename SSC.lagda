\section{A calculus with single substitutions}
\label{sec:SSC}

We are very minimalistic, we only introduce operations and equations
which we are forced to introduce.

% no cubical, no Szumi trick

% U : Ty Γ -- we write the indices
% weak Coquand: Tm Γ (U i) = Ty i Γ, _[_]{Ty} = _[_]{Tm}{U} (let's see!)

% in SSC, we don't have democracy because we can't have Sub Γ Δ = Tm Γ (K Δ) as on the lhs we have a single substitution
