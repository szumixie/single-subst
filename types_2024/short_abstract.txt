Type theory in type theory using single substitutions

The well-typed quotiented (intrinsic) syntax of type theory can be
defined as the initial category with families (CwF) with extra
structure corresponding to the type formers. The initial model is
implemented in type theory by a quotient inductive-inductive type. In
this talk we describe a simpler alternative to CwFs using single
substitutions and single weakenings. These are not composable, so the
syntax is not based on a category (the families are still there). In
addition to computation and uniqueness rules, the equations we have
are all naturality equations (also called substitution laws such as
"(app t u)[γ] = app (t[γ]) (u[γ])"), there are five equations
describing interaction of variables and single
substitutions/weakenings, and four extra equations for types. The
rules for CwF are provable from our rules by induction on the single
substitution syntax. We have more models than CwFs, the situation is
similar to the correspondence between combinatory logic and lambda
calculus. Our single substitution calculus is a simpler variant of
Voevodsky's B-systems (while his C-systems correspond to CwFs). We
formalised a type theory with a universe and Pi types based on single
substitutions in Agda, and derived the rules for CwF using the
technique of alpha-normalisation.
