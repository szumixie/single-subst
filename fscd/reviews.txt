----- TEXT:
The paper under review introduces a novel algebraic presentation of Martin-Loef type theory which has two main features: (i) it is intrinsic, and (ii) it only has single substitutions (as opposed to parallel ones). It is the first
presentation combining these two aspects, and it may be understood as a B-system (essentially algebraic single substution presentation) presented as a Generalised Algebraic Theory (GAT). The main interesting consequence of this
combination is that the presentation requires very few equations: the core substitution calculus (called SSC for single substitution calculus) has only 8 (and they can be reduced even further). The core SSC theory is very general and
rather weak. However the authors show that by adding a universe and dependent function types (Pi-types) one recovers the same syntax as the one of categories with families (CwF). More precisely, the SSC with a universe and Pi-types
has more models than CwFs, but the initial ones are isomorphic (t
his is Problem 6). The paper is well-written, the introduction is clear and provides motivation and comparison with related works. Overall, I consider this submission a valuable contribution to the study of type systems, so I
strongly recommend acceptance.
----------- Questions for authors (optional) -----------
Specific comments and typos:
1. lines 64-65, why only natural models come with their creator's name? (I understand Ehrhard's notion does not have a name, so it needs its creator's name)
2. In various places you speak of "equivalent" systems, but it is not always clear to me what you mean by that. E.g. line 93, in what sense B-systems are equivalent to CwF? Certainly it is not an equivalence of categories, that one
exists between Bsys and Csys. If you are only referring to the syntax, then it would be good to specify so. This happens again in lines 149-150.
3. line 178, typo: a model of the GAT _that_ we obtain
4. line 221. Maybe Set could be called Sort in the paper?
5. lines 227-228. I think these sentences are missing a conjunction or something.
6. lines 231-232. These sentences also sound odd, maybe drop the last 'is'?
7. line 233. It is not clear to me what you mean by: "We instantiate the type with the Sub[...] weakening." Which type are you speaking about? What is "the the Sub[...] weakening"?
8. line 311. I think it's be more appropriate to say "a finite number" rather than "a couple".
9. Please highlight the terms defined: line 416 a category with N-many families, and line 445 \alpha-normal.
10. line 475-476. I think Sub*s is a typo (occurring two times).
11. section 4. This is a very clever trick, but I suggest you take one more sentence to explain it: you made explicit that you use the U[] instance to get the equation for types, and I think it would be good if you add that you use
the conditional equation _again_ to get that for terms. This could go for instance right after you prove that the equation for types hold.
12. line 536. Typo: the second labelled equation has a ) which should not be there.
13. line 568-569. The sentence starting "as most sorts..." is a bit obscure to me: in Section 2 you speak of a sort of types and one of terms, etc. But now you seem to suggest that these are terms instead.
14. line 618. It would be good if you could give some motivation for this function not be definable.
15. Ref. [24]. Capitalise Martin-Loef.

## Summary
In an earlier paper [38], the authors explain how to translate SOGATs to GATs, in two ways: either using explicit parallel substitutions, or using explicit single-variable substitutions (and weakenings).
In this paper, the results of these two translations are formally compared after applying them to the SOGAT of dependent type theory (with or without certain type formers); these resulting SOGATs are called the theory of CwFs
(categories with (N many) families) and the SSC (single substitution calculus, def. 1, with an equivalent but more minimal axiomatization in def. 7).
It is fairly trivial that the SSC translates to the theory of CwFs, therefore that every CwF is an SSC model.
The authors show, however, that the initial CwF has the same contexts, types and terms as the initial SSC model (Problem 6).
It is also claimed that if the SOGAT of dependent types is equipped with Π-types, Σ-types and a universe hierarchy, then the resulting theory of CwFs is "weakly equivalent" to the resulting SSC, although the authors seem partly
unsure what that even means (Problem 11 and below), and as such a full proof is not given. Therefore the claim seems overblown.

## Evaluation
I think the paper provides new results, which are (mostly - see major comments) clearly stated and so are their limitations. Textual argumentation and Agda formalizations create confidence in the results.
I find the paper (mostly - see major comments) acceptably well-written.
My main reservation is that I have no decisive answer to the question "Why are these results important?", neither from my own knowledge nor from the paper's exposition.

## Major comments
As mentioned in the summary above, the claim that for type theory with Π-types, Σ-types and a universe hierarchy, the theory of CwFs is "weakly equivalent" to the SSC, is not well-defined and not fully substantiated. This should be
honestly acknowledged everywhere.
- Problem 11: What is a contextual isomorphism? Why are `F_Con` and `F_Sub` not required to be invertible?

I think the second half of §2.1 is a bit sloppy:
- For Σ-types, it is suddenly mentioned that naturalities in one direction are derivable, but the argument used seems to apply to any type former with η.
- On ln 400, an admissible equation is suddenly used. It's not clear to me why this is ok at this point (i.e. why should we not stick to derivable equations). At a higher level, it is not clear to me what this part of narrative is
trying to accomplish.
- ln 411: using equations to be introduced later, did not improve readability imho.

## Minor comments
- Somewhat important in my opinion: a theorem environment labelled "Problem" gives the impression of an *open* problem. Alternative labels could be specification, constructive theorem, object, inhabitation problem, ...
Alternatively/additionally, "construction" could be replaced by "solution".

- ln 39: for clarity "an alternative intrinsic presentation"
- A general writing advice is not to start sentences with a mathematical symbol (e.g. ln 58)
- The word "instantiation" is used often but not really introduced; it is not clear whether it is regarded as synonymous with substitution or has a slightly different meaning.
- ln 143: explain the appearance of the Agda logo upon first use
- ln 148: parentheses around `-,-`
- ln 149: the authors could be more clear about what it means for GATs to be equivalent
- ln 164: shallowLY embedding
- ln 172: simply modelled by -> simly abstracted over / axiomatized by
- ln 184: categorIES with families
- ln 310: "there are no equations on Sub": the authors could add that there is a good reason for this: many of the relevant equations involve composition of substitutions, and this is not defined for substitutions themselves, but it
is for their actions on types and terms
- ln 348: metacircular is not explained
- ln 384-386: It took me a while to figure out what is meant and whether it's true. I think "what we cannot do" is insufficiently precise: it can be done admissibly (as, by induction, every context is known to have a length), but it
is not derivable.
- ln 431-432: "Note that we do not have the non-lifted term versions of the last two equations in SSC": this sentence confused me. I find non-lifted versions of all four equations:
  (4) ln 285, first equation
  (5) ln 322, first equation
  (6) ln 317, first equation
  (7) ln 329, second equation
  EDIT: Oh, ok, it's about *term* versions, perhaps this should be typographically emphasized.
- ln 445 and on: Given that αβη-equality is encoded by quotienting, i.e. as metatheoretic equality, any predicate will be closed under αβη-equality. As such, strictly speaking, and I think it is helpful to say this explicitly, a term
is α-normal if it is αβη-equal to a term that does not contain instantiation operations.
- ln 456: "It is important ...": I do not understand this statement at all. Again, since αβη-equality is encoded as metatheoretic equality, any predicate will preserve the conversion rules. This is unrelated to the predicate being
truncated.
- ln 509: "the initial SSC *model*" (in general please double check the hygienic use of terminology surrounding GATs: there is a theory, there is a model of the theory, there is a category of models, and each has its own name)
- ln 522: Coquand universes: perhaps briefly explain this term or refer somewhere
- ln 568-569: Do you mean "most sort inhabitants"? Or "appear as types"? If it is meant as stated, I do not understand.
- ln 606: SSC *model*

# Questions
1. A lot of the presented material is formalized in Agda. A recurring theme is admissibility vs. derivability. Is there a way to reason about this in Agda, and do the authors make use of this?
2. To what extent can the central result in the paper (problem 6) be factored through the following result/conjecture:
   For any CwF, the category of parallel substitutions is exactly presented (†) by the graph of single-variable weakenings and substitutions, subject to the equations in def. 1 / def. 7 (expressed not as equations on type/term
actions but as equations on morphisms in the free category over that graph).

Summary:

The paper describes a single substitution calculus for type theory. It defines weakening by one element and lifting of weakenings, together with single substitution. Furthermore, it defines 4 equations for substitutions and 4
equations on types needed for typechecking. It introduces the idea of alpha-normalform which essentially pushes instantiations to the variables. We can simulate parallel substitutions by iterating single substitutions. Furthermore,
the paper shows that the syntax of the single substitution calculus is weakly equivalent to CwFs.

Evaluation:

The paper clearly spells out the equations and definitions of single weakenings and substitutions; it is indeed written in a pedagogical style, as the authors mention in the conclusion. However, I still cannot get excited about this
paper. Most of the definitions seem reasonable and are not surprising. They are mostly tedious to write down in detail. The connection to CwF is a nice result, but also not surprising. Last, while the type theory is minimalistic in a
certain sense, it is less clear to me what the benefit of SSC in practice. For example, is it an effective approach to mechanize meta-theory?  The paper would be stronger, if it could show that this single substitution approach is
indeed as effective (or more effective?) as the simultaneous substitution approach when it comes to mechanizing meta-properties.
